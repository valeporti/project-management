# Data Analysis for Project Management Office
IT Project Management (SDLC - Waterfall)

## What is this?
In the folders you will be able to find VBA code about a report generator for IT Project Alerts.

They contain the modules used by each button ([watch video](https://youtu.be/wxJ1JsdVFV0)) starting with a "A_".

Also the functions (returning a value) and subs (not returning a value) starting with a "K_".

*In the [video](https://youtu.be/wxJ1JsdVFV0) you could see the "Dashboard Generator".
